* Participants are expected to be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free from personal attacks and disparaging remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behavior that could reasonably be considered harassment will not be tolerated.

## Reporting

If you believe these guidelines have been violated, please contact the project maintainers.

## Attribution
